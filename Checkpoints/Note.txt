I will store fresh copies of each Jupyter Notebook file in this folder. 

The names of these files will end in "_v0".

Each Jupyter Notebook file will also be stored in the "Introduction to Python" folder 
without this suffix.

[Each notebook (except for the Jupyter Notebook tutorial) will begin with a Markdown cell which
prompts students to enter their name.]

[Each time students begin working in a new notebook, I will instruct them to enter their name
in this cell and save a new version of their notebook ending in "_v1".]

I will also store completed versions of each notebook in the Checkpoints folder. The names of 
these files  will end in "_vF".
